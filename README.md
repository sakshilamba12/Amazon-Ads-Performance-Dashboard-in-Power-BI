# Amazon-Ads-Performance-Dashboard-in-Power-BI
Designed a Power BI dashboard by combining Sponsored Product, Sponsored Brand, and Sponsored Display ad data. Performed data cleaning, merging, and created insights on sales, spend, ROAS, and category-wise performance using visuals like tables, bar charts, and slicers.

# Key Features & Insights
Merged Sponsored Product (SP), Sponsored Brand (SB), and Sponsored Display (SD) ad data into a unified dashboard using Power BI.
Used Power Query to clean and transform data, including category mapping via ASIN.
Added dynamic columns like Ad Type and Month to support time-based and campaign-based analysis.
Built calculated measure for ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) to evaluate ad effectiveness.
Created a pivot-style summary table to break down performance by Month, Category, Ad Type, and ASIN.
Developed bar and line charts to visualize category-wise sales and monthly sales trends.
Applied interactive slicers to filter reports by Category, Month, and Ad Type for deeper insights.
Discovered top-performing categories and high-ROI ASINs, while also identifying areas with high spend but low returns.
Enabled performance comparison between ad types over time, helping in better budget allocation and strategy planning.

# Why This Project Stands Out
Unified View of Multiple Ad Types: Unlike basic dashboards, this project brings together SP, SB, and SD data into one cohesive model, enabling holistic performance analysis.
Dynamic and Scalable: Built using Power BI and Power Query, the solution is dynamicâ€”new data can be added easily without breaking the structure
Business-Centric Insights: Goes beyond numbers to provide real, actionable insights such as identifying top-performing categories and poor ROI areas.
Automation & Clean Design: Eliminates manual merging of sheets by automating transformations and category mapping using robust Power Query techniques.
Decision-Making Ready: With ROAS calculation, trend charts, and interactive filters, it empowers business teams to make smarter, data-driven decisions.

# Project Highlights
Integrated Data Model: Combined Sponsored Products (SP), Sponsored Brands (SB), and Sponsored Display (SD) into one master dataset using Power Query.
Automated Category Mapping: Used merging techniques to enrich ad data with product categories from a master ASIN-category sheet.
Dynamic Month Column: Created a clean Month field from raw dates to enable easy time-based filtering and trend analysis.
Custom ROAS Metric: Defined a calculated measure for ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) to evaluate efficiency of advertising spend.
Interactive Visuals:
Pivot-style summary table with Month, Category, Ad Type, and ASIN performance.
Bar chart showing top-performing product categories by sales.
Line chart showing monthly sales trends by ad type.
Slicers for easy filtering by Month, Ad Type, and Category.
User-Friendly Interface: Clean layout with actionable insights that non-technical users can easily explore.
